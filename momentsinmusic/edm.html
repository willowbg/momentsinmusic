                   Paul Oakenfold describes his early life as a "bedroom DJ", stating he grew up listening to The Beatles. In 1981, 18-year-old Oakenfold and his friend Ian Paul moved to New York City. Oakenfold worked as a courier in West Harlem, Oakenfold and Paul used fake identification to sneak into various dance clubs, like Studio 54, where they met members of the bands, whom they interviewed, claiming to be journalists. Returning to London, Oakenfold began breaking into the mainstream, as an A&R man for Champion Records. In 1987, Oakenfold travelled to the island of Ibiza for a week to celebrate his birthday. While there, he convinced the owner of a club to an after hours dance party, thus starting what is known as raves. Starting in 1990, Oakenfold teamed up with his friend Steve Osbourne to make remixes of various songs. Following the success of these songs, Oakenfold went on to make a solo career where he made his own remixes and went on his own tours. Oakenfold is still active today, although he is more behind the scenes, heading the department of DJs and EDM at Isina, worldwide talent search and development mentorship program. </p>

                    While Synth Pop was still popular in the US, 1980 is said to be when techno music and raves begin. Paul Oakenfold was a major contributor to creating what is now known as a rave. Starting off as small parties, these raves became a new trend that involved dressing up as if one was going to the club and lots of drinking. Lots of the people that went to these parties, however, were underaged women. Other than the red flag of illegally being under the influence of alcohol, these young women that attended these raves were also at a major risk for sexual assault, abuse, and human trafficking. While Oakenfold did make a benefit to society by creating a different, more inclusive party scene, he also normalized underage drinking as well as put many young women at risk. </p>

                   At just the young age of 12, Tijs Michiel Verwest, better known by his stage name as Tiësto knew what he wanted to do with his life. Struck by a passion for music, Tiësto started DJing professionally for school parties and dances by age 14. Between 1985 and 1994, Tiësto began a residency at several clubs in the Netherlands, where he fine-tuned his own live style by performing from 10 p.m. until 4 a.m. on weekends. In late 1994, Tiësto signed to Basic Beat, however he didn’t stay there for long. In 1997 he and friend Arny Bink left to create their own label, called “Black Hole Recordings”. Using this label, he and Ferry Corsten released their remix of Delerium's "Silence" featuring Sarah McLachlan in 2000, thus starting the trance era of EDM and making Tiësto a more mainstream name in DJing. Tiësto’s solo career is said to have started in 2001 when he created a new sub-label, Magik Muzik, and released his first solo album, “In My Memory”, which contained 5 major hits. From there, he went on to release several popular albums and even performed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Tiësto is still active today, winning a Grammy in 2015 for his remixed track of John Legend’s “All of Me” and collaborating with artists like Post Malone.</p>

                   By 1990, EDM started to gain popularity in the US, however it was still extremely popular in Europe. This decade saw the creation of Trance Music, which was pioneered by Tiësto. Trance Music, being slower than most EDM tracks is known for its soothing and electronic sound. In fact, trance music has been shown to reduce anxiety levels and lower heart rate, thus increasing productivity. But, the effects of trance music aren’t all beneficial. Many listeners enjoy hearing trance because of its calming effects and the effect it has on their mood. But what happens when they aren’t at a show or can’t listen to it? Listeners of trance found themselves missing the feelings that trance music gave to them, and turned to another way of finding that feeling: drugs. This effect of trance music is still in effect today, with drugs like ecstasy being still popular at raves. </p>

                    The late 1990s and early 2000’s is when EDM gained popularity in the US. Since This is specifically seen in the genre of Dubstep, a genre that combined Skrillex's hardcore and emo roots with EDM. Before this time, musical combinations of genres of this kind were kept separate; with hardcore and emo music being seen as the “ugly duckling” of the music industry and EDM being seen as the party scene of the music industry. However, Skrillex made a monumental change in combining these two genres to create a genre of its own. Listeners of both EDM and hardcore and emo music flocked to this new genre, allowing them to find something that brought their two worlds together. Through his career Skrillex not only changed the sound of EDM, but he also brought emo style back into the mainstream. He helped make emo cool again, and in doing so made many of his listeners feel comfortable in being true to themselves.  </p>

                   After seeing Tiësto perform at the Athens Olympics in 2004, Garrix knew he wanted to be a DJ. At the age of 8, he downloaded music composing software and taught himself how to compose electronic music. He went to Herman Brood Academy, a production school in Utrecht to further his music production knowledge. After years of practice, Garrix released remixes of songs in hopes that one day he would get noticed, and in 2012 that is exactly what happened. At age 16 was discovered by his idol Tiësto and was immediately signed to the label Spinnin Records. In 2013, Garrix graduated from Herman Brood Academy, and released his first song “Animals”. The song became an immediate hit, and allowed Garrix to become the youngest person to reach number one on Beatport. In 2015, Garrix left Spinnin Records over a conflict on ownership of his own music. He went on to make his own record label “Stmpd Rcrds” where he released hits such as “In the Name of Love (2016)” and “Scared to be Lonely (2017)”. </p>
