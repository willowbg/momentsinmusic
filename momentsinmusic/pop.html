                    Born in December of 1915, Francis Albert Sinatra, known to us as just Frank Sinatra, became a star of all sorts. He was an actor, producer, and most notably a singer. His music career took off in the late 1940’s with his hit "Polka Dots and Moonbeams" followed by two other singles, “Say It” and “Imagination” later that decade. After the success with his singles, Sinatra took a break from singing to pursue his acting career. He starred in “Reveille With Beverley” and “Higher and Higher” before winning an Academy Award for his role in “The House I Live In”. After these roles, however Sinatra’s popularity went downhill causing him to lose recording contracts and film contracts. Sinatra quickly gained popularity back in the mid 1950’s, with his oscar-winning role in the film “From Here to Eternity” and continued to gain his popularity back with his new, more mature-sounding music albums. Although successful in his acting and singing career, Sinatra was not so lucky with his marriages. Sinatra had been married four times, and divorced three times before his death in 1998, having three children with only his first wife.  </p>

                    Frank Sinatra has made many large impacts in the music industry. He pioneered what is now known as pop music and even made a record label of his own. However, Sinatra’s impact has affected many social situations outside of music. With his career being most successful in a time of segregation in America, Sinatra strived to make a change with his career. While he was popular, he used his influence to promote African American musicians, such as Harry “Sweets” Edison. When these artists worked with Sinatra, he made sure that they were paid well and treated with respect, and even went so far as to instruct his bodyguards to “break anyone’s nose that looked at [these musicians] funny”. Additionally, Sinatra was very passionate about politics. He is said to be a vital influence in John F. Kennedy’s election in 1960. </p>

                    Consisting of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, the Beatles started off as an English rock band in 1960. Led by the band's primary songwriters, Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in the U.K. over a three-year period starting in 1960. In late 1962, the Beatles hit the jackpot with their song “Love Me Do” gaining massive popularity in Europe. In early 1964, the Beatles gained international fame and leading the “British Invasion” of music into the U.S. Soon after that, in 1964, the group made their first film appearance in “A Hard Day’s Night”, and continued to turn out hit record after hit record. The band’s streak of good vibes didn’t last long, and broke up in 1970. Many fans claim that the reason for this split was due to John Lennon’s marriage to Yoko Ono, however the band claims that the reason for the split was increasing arguments between band members.  </p>

                    The Beatles made a major impact on teens of the 1960’s with the frenzy of “Beatlemania”. This frenzy or phenomenon was used to describe the tendency for teenagers to look to someone of their own age group as role models and for social values. Through their songs they sparked a cultural change in the teens of this time to change culture and take an oppositional stance against the establishment. Though none of the lyrics of their songs say these things out front, there are many stories on how the Beatles inspired change. According to cultural commentator, Steven Stark, the social unity conveyed by the Beatles from the start of their career inspired the framework for the collectivist thinking that distinguished the 1960s and the emergence of the counterculture movement. Former Cold War spies have even gone so far as to credit the Beatles’ music for helping persuade young Russians to defy communist ideology and begin the process that led to the fall of communism throughout Eastern Europe. With this, one could say that the Beatles really did want to change the world, and in a way, they succeeded.  </p>

                   Born David Robert Jones, David Bowie broke into the U.K. Charts with his hit single “Space Oddity” in July 1969. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. This character led the success of his single "Starman" and album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, which won him widespread popularity. This success continued in the early 1981, when Bowie collaborated with Queen on one of the biggest songs of the decade, “Under Pressure”. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles and also continued acting; his roles including Jareth the Goblin King in Labyrinth (1986) and Nikola Tesla in The Prestige (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. Bowie remained musically active until he died of liver cancer at his home in New York City, two days after the release of his final album, "Blackstar (2016)".</p>

                   <p class="more br"> 
                    In addition to his music career, Bowie is also known for his openness with his sexuality. On many occasions, Bowie has confirmed his bisexuality, even while married to his first wife. This can ultimately be seen most through his portrayal of androgenous character Ziggy Stardust. With his openness about his sexuality, Bowie lessened the stigma and made the idea of androgyny and sexuality other than heterosexuality more of an everyday conversation. Many listeners of Bowie claim that he made them feel more comfortable in their own skin, and allowed them to feel more comfortable sharing their sexuality with the public. Bowie is still seen as an icon today for this reason and has without a doubt made an impact in how sexuality is seen in society. </p>

                   Michael Jackson, also dubbed “The King of Pop” first got his start in the Jackson 5, with his older brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermain, and Marlon. With hits including “ABC (1970)” and “I’ll Be There (1970)” the Jackson 5 became child stars, and as they aged, teenage idols. As the group aged, members of the Jackson 5 were replaced with other brothers and Jackson ultimately became the groups sole songwriter into the late 1970s. During his last few years of being in the Jackson 5, Jackson created his own solo albums, creating his fifth and most renowned album in 1979, called “Off the Wall”. Jackson went on to create many more albums and hits including “Thriller (1982)”, “We are the World (1985)”, and “Bad (1987)”. In addition to his hits, Jackson faced many scandals, including child sexual abuse alligations and criticisms on his sudden change of appearance. Jackson died in 2009 as a result of propofol overdose, administered by his doctor, Conrad Murray.</p>

                    Despite many controversies, Jackson is known to have broken racial barriers in the music industry through his music, such as those in the song “Black and White (1991)”. Jackson made a big impact in the music performance industry, by turning music performing into an art form and using his music as a promotional tool. In addition, Jackson brought many world issues into light through his music. The song “Man in the Mirror (1987)” focuses on the idea of climate change and how everyone in society has the ability to make a change in the world. He brought to light the issue of humanitarian problems in Africa with his 1985 song “We Are the World”, of which he donated all the proceeds to charity. That being said, Jackson still did have many controversies revolving around child sexual abuse which he is arguably more known for than his charity work. Overall, it is up to the public to decide the impact that Michael Jackson had on them and society. </p>

After multiple musical roles and small television roles, Spears signed to Jive Records in late 1997, at the young age of 16, where she released her single “...Baby One More Time” one year later. Her first album, being the same name of the single, was released in 1999 and gained massive popularity and praise. Her second album “Oops... I Did it Again” was released just one year later, and gained even more popularity and praise. As Britney stayed in the spotlight, she struggled with relationships. Her relationships included Justin Timberlake, and ex-husbands Jason Alexander and Kevin Federline, whom she had 2 children with. Shortly after the divorce of Federline in 2007, Spears underwent many personal struggles that caused her to turn away from the spotlight, including drug abuse and custody battles with her children. However, in 2008 she bounced back with her hit album “Circus” and has been making hits ever since.  </p>

                    Without a doubt Britney is most known for her public breakdowns which were captured by the media. Although portrayed negatively by the media, these breakdowns were perceived as an inspiration to many young women at the time. One of Britney’s biggest breakdowns was at the time from her divorce from Kevin Federline, when she lost custody of her children. Many women in a similar situation of divorcing their husbands and losing custody of their children, cite Britney as a source of inspiration for them. Although Britney ultimately lost custody of her children, she was persistent in her efforts to win her children back which inspired other women to persevere through the hardships of custody battles. However, Britney did not let this loss get to her. She continued striving to be successful in career, inspiring others to continue with their lives even in times of loss. Overall, Spears proved to her fans and the world that the show must go on.  </p>

Within a few days, he was signed to RBMG Records, partially owned by famous musician Usher. In the next year, he put out his first EP “My World”, which shortly became platinum in the US. With that debut album, he became the first artist to have seven tracks from a debut album be placed on the Billboard 100 - and all of this was done before the boy turned 16 years old. Bieber’s success continued with his first full length album “My World 2.0” which was released in 2010 and became triple platinum. Bieber has so far released four albums, each more successful than the last. In addition, Bieber has collaborated with many artists on tracks that have ranked high on the Billboard 100. Some of these artists include Skrillex and Diplo on the song “Where are Ü Now (2012)”, Ed Sheeran on the song “I Don’t Care (2019)”, and Billie Eilish on the remix of her song “Bad Guy (2019)”. </p>

                    Justin Bieber immediately made young girls fall head over heels for him when he debuted in 2008. In a craze called “Bieber Fever”, kids as young as four years old were devoting every waking moment they were awake and every dollar they had to support Bieber. Obviously parents were not happy about this new craze because they believed Bieber was teaching the children bad habits and giving them false aspirations. This frustration that parents had with Bieber only worsened as Bieber got older. As Bieber came of age, he started to do what any other normal teen would do: get tattoos, drink, and party. However even though Bieber came of age, many of his fans were still underage and were looking up to him as a role model. Parents, undoubtedly struggled to keep their teens from wanting to follow the ways of Bieber, but luckily enough in 2018 Bieber settled down and married Haley Baldwin. Since then, he has been laying low and causing minimal problems for the benefit of himself and his fans.</p>
