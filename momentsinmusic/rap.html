                    TThe Sugarhill Gang is an American hip hop trio consisting of Michael “Wonder Mike” Wright, Henry “Big Bank Hank” Jackson, and Guy “Master Gee” O’Brien. Their 1979 hit "Rapper's Delight" was the first rap single to become a Top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. This was the only hit from the trio in the US, although they didn’t let that stop them. In Europe, the group had multiple hits in the 1980s, with songs such as “8th Wonder (1980)”, and “Showdown (1980)” and did a few tours there. The group wound down in the late 1980s, however, they reunited in 1999 to record a children’s album entitled “Jump On It!”. The group stayed fairly quiet after this until November 2014, when Big Bank Hank died from his battle with cancer. Two years later in 2016, the remaining living members of the original Sugarhill Gang, including Wonder Mike, Hendogg and Master Gee embarked on their first world tour in over a decade under the name The Sugarhill Gang. During this, they performed as the Sugarhill Gang for the Art of Rap festival tour in 2016, and at V Festival in Hylands Park and Weston Park in the UK as part of their world tour in 2016.  </p>

                    The Sugarhill Gang made major impacts on the music society by pioneering the genre of rap. It is important to note that The Sugarhill Gang did not invent rap. Rap had been around for decades before the 1970’s, but The Sugarhill Gang were the artists to make it popular. They proved to society that rap was a genre of music, and that one could be successful in making it. With their song they proved that music wasn’t all about the melodies and lyrics that a song was composed of, but also the rhythm. Ultimately their contributions to rap did not reach past their one hit of “Rapper’s Delight”, making them a One Hit Wonder. However, their contribution of popularizing the genre of rap inspired generations of other future rappers. </p>

                   Run-DMC was an American hip hop group from Hollis, Queens, New York, founded in 1983 by Joseph “Run” Simmons, Darryl “DMC” McDaniels, and Jason “Jam Master Jay” Mizell. The group got their start recording their own tracks as high school students after meeting up at a park in the late 1970s. In the early 1980s the group was signed to Profile Records, and in late 1983 released their first single "It's Like That/Sucker MCs". Their single was received well by the public and placed #15 on the R&B charts. Emboldened by their success, Run-DMC released their eponymous debut album Run-D.M.C. in 1984. Hit singles such as "Jam-Master Jay" and "Hard Times" proved that the group were more than a one-hit wonder, unlike The Sugarhill Gang. After the success of their first album, Run-DMC looked to branch out on their follow-up. The release of King of Rock in 1985 saw the group furthering their rap rock fusion on songs like "Can You Rock It Like This" and the title track; while "Roots, Rap, Reggae" was one of the first rap/dancehall hybrids. The group had continued success with their five subsequent album releases until the group broke up in 2002 due to Mizell’s murder. </p>

                    Run D.M.C. impacted the African-American music community through their music and songs. Not only did their lyrics and the messages in their lyrics become included in American culture, but they also broke racial barriers by working with white artists, such as Aerosmith. In addition to making impacts in music, they also helped out African-American communities by giving back to inner-city schools by speaking to students and assemblies and being youth mentors to these children. Run DMC also impacted the fashion society with their 1985 single “My Adidas”. This song popularized the companies clothing, causing fans of the group to support the company of Adidas. This effect can still be seen in modern day, with the sneaker company making a limited number of Run D.M.C. sneakers inspired sneakers in 2011. </p>

                   Being one of the largest groups in Hip Hop, Wu-Tang Clan was formed in the New York City borough of Staten Island in 1992. The group originally consisted of cousins Robert “RZA” Diggs, Gary “GZA” Grice, and Russel “Ol’ Dirty Bastard” Jones, but they decided to expand the group after the trio collaborated with other rappers on separate occasions. Before releasing their first album, Wu-Tang Clan had 10 members: RZA, GZA, Ol’ Dirty Bastard, Jason “Inspectah Duck” Hunter, Lamont “U-God” Hawkins, Dennis “Ghostface Killah” Coles, Clifford “Method Man” Smith, Corey “Raekwon” Woods, Jamel “Masta Killa” Irief, and Darryl “Cappodonna” Hill. The group released their first single "Protect Ya Neck", in 1993 independently before signing with Loud/RCA records. In November 1993 the group released their first album, “Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)” which received critical acclaim, and is regarded as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time. Members of the group continued to work on their solo albums during this time. The group got back together in 1997 to record their second album “Wu-Tang Forever” and again in 2000 and 2001 to release the albums “The W” and “Iron Flag”, respectively. The group is still active today both as the Wu-Tang Clan and as solo rappers, except for Russel “Ol’ Dirty Bastard” Jones, who died of a drug overdose in 2004.</p>

                    The Wu-Tang Clan has made a huge impact in the hip hop community and on society. They became one of the first groups to use their own ‘code’ for certain words in their music, with "Biscuits" being guns, "sharks" being those who "bit" (or copied) their style, "Earths" being women. In addition the Wu-Tang Clan is said to have been one of the first rap groups who of the more violent lyrics associated with rap music. They were also one of the first groups to normalize using drugs within their lyrics, leading to their listeners trying and abusing drugs. Some of these listeners ultimately suffered the same result as former Wu-Tang Clan member Ol’ Dirty Bastard, by passing away from accidental drug overdoses.  </p>

                   Marshall Bruce Mathers III better known as his stage name, Eminem, is an extremely successful rapper best known for his 1999 “Slim Shady LP”. His next two releases, "The Marshall Mathers LP (2000)" and "The Eminem Show (2002)", were worldwide successes, both being nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. In 2002, Eminem also starred in the movie “8 Mile” as a fictionalized version of himself. The film won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for "Lose Yourself", making Eminem the first rapper to win the award. His next album, "Encore", was released in 2004, which faced heavy criticism by fans and critics for its lacklustre quality. Eminem went on hiatus after touring in 2005 partly due to a prescription drug addiction. After a few years, he released "Relapse (2009)" and "Recovery (2010)", with both winning Grammy Awards for Best Rap Album. "The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013)", also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album; it expanded his record for the most wins in the category. With over 170 million records sold globally, Eminem is among the best-selling music artists of all time.

                    Although a popular and successful rapper, Eminem has had a negative impact on some of his listeners. Not only did he set a poor relationship and marriage with his ex-wife, but he has also written songs portraying women in a negative manner. This is especially seen in the “Marshall Mathers LP (2000)”  where eleven of the fourteen songs contained elements of misogyny and his song “Kim (2000)” about his ex-wife containing lyrics such as “Sit down, b***h! You move again I'll beat the s**t out of you! (Okay!)”. This misogyny became an issue when fans of Eminem started treating women in a similar manner as Eminem portrayed in his lyrics. Eminem has since apologized many times for his misogynistic lyrics, but that doesn’t change the fact that the songs are still out for anyone to stream and listen to. </p>

                    West has been the subject of many controversies, including his instance at the 2009 VMAs where he interrupted Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech for “Best Female Video”. However, one of his most recent controversies comes from his political views. West has been an avid supporter of (now impeached) President Donald Trump, saying that he loves Trump and praising Trump for his views on the Free World. In addition, West has shown support for similar causes as Trump, including criticizing the Black Lives Matter movement. Kanye West has had an effect on many African-American voters with his avid support of Trump. Through his support, he has influenced these voters to reflect on their values and Trump’s values and overall to reflect on their opinion of Trump as a president. </p>
