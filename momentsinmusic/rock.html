                    <p class="more">
                    Elvis Presley, better known as just Elvis, made breakthroughs in the genre of Rock. Known as “The King of Rock and Roll”, Elvis mixed his blues-y soulful voice and electric guitars, Elvis paved the way for many future rock musicians. Elvis is best known for his songs “Hound Dog” (1956) and “Can’t help falling in love” (1961). Though he made an impact with the new style of his music, perhaps one of the biggest controversies surrounding Elvis is his death. Elvis Presley passed away in August 1977 on the toilet in his memphis home, reportedly due to cardiac arrest. There is suspicion, however, that drugs and narcotics played a role in Elvis’ death. </p>

                    Elvis redefined what is now known as rock music, however, this impact did not come without negative effects. Many of those who criticized Elvis’ music called it  “the music of the devil”. This was largely in part due to Elvis himself, and not his music.  Elvis’ physical attractiveness and sexual appeal were widely acknowledged. Because of his sexual attractiveness, young girls were instantly drawn to him. The hip movements that Presely would do while he was performing also had young girls swooning over him in mass numbers. The mass appeal of Elvis to young girls made critics feel as though he was the real life embodiment of the devil sent to attract and use the young girls who were attracted to him for “the devil’s work”. </p>

                <p class="more">
                    Despite his short career, Jimi Hendrix is known as one of the most influential guitarists and rock artists of the 20th century. While Hendrix is most known for his solo career, Hendrix was part of a band called “The Jimi Hendrix Experience” in 1966. Hendrix is most known for his song “Purple Haze”, made with the band in 1967. In 1969 The Jimi Hendrix experience split up, citing Hendrix’s unpredictable work ethic and his creative control of the Experience’s music as the reason for the split. Hendrix went on to record a solo album entitled “Band of Gypsys” later that year which was released on New Year’s day of 1970. Through his years in the music industry, Hendrix was known to drink heavily and abusing drugs, such as heroin and marijuana. This drug abuse ultimately led to his death when he died September 17th, 1970 from barbiturate-related asphyxia at the young age of 27. </p>

                    Hendrix pioneered what we know as rock music today, with his electric guitars and amplified sound effects. He paved the way for how rock music was seen in society and made it more of a cultural norm as opposed to an oddball music genre. Hendrix used alcohol quite heavily, causing him to reportedly break out in a drunken rage. Additionally, Hendrix was also a user of heavy drugs. Not only did Hendrix use marijuana, but he also used Heroin and LSD, a euphoric and hallucinogenic drug, respectively. There are many reports that Hendrix used these drugs before performing, which in turn inspired many listeners to try the drugs in order to be more like Hendrix. Hendrix is known to have aided in the antiwar movement of the 60’s. His song “Machine Gun” became an antiwar anthem and was used as an aid to cease war in Vietnam.  </p>

                   KISS was a rock band formed in New York in 1973. The band originally consisted of four members: Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons, Peter Criss, and Ace Frehley. However, the original members that remain are Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons. Kiss is most recognizable for their use of black and white face paint, which is unique to each member of the band. Each member of the band has their own “character” that they play on stage. Currently the characters in the band consist of: The Demon (played by Gene Simmons), The Starchild (played by Paul Stanley), The Catman (originally played by Peter Criss, but now played by Eric Singer), and The Spaceman (originally played by Ace Frehley, but now played by Tommy Thayer). KISS is most known for their singles “I was Made for Loving You” (1993) and “Rock and Roll all Nite” (1975). </p>

                    KISS made a major impact on the music society by their branding. Not only did KISS have one of the first band logos, but they plastered it everywhere. From lunchboxes, to coffee mugs, and even caskets. However, the lead singer of KISS, Gene Simmons has some dark secrets. Simmons has bragged about the number of women he has slept with, no doubt due to his fame. As of 2010, Simmons said this number has reached over 5,000, and Simmons has admitted to having polaroid photos and hotel room keys from each encounter. In addition, Simmons has made negative comments on mental health. In 2014 with an interview with Songfacts.com, Simmons openly encouraged those suffering with depression to kill themselves. Simmons received backlash from this comment, and many radio stations pulled KISS songs from their line-up because of this comment. Simmons later clarified his comments and apologized  for the incident.</p>

                   Guns N’ Roses is perhaps one of the most well known rock bands of the 1980s. Although they did not form until the middle of the decade, they rose to fame after they debuted their first album “Appetite for Destruction” in 1987. The band originally consisted of Axl Rose on vocals, famous guitarist Slash on lead guitar, Izzy Stradlin on rhythm guitar, Duff McKagan on bass, and Steven Adler on drums. However, band members have changed frequently over the past 30 years. Rose, Slash, and McKagan remain the only original members of the band, and have added Dizzy Reed as a keyboardist, Richard Fortus on guitar, Frank Ferrer on drums, and female keyboardist Melissa Reese. </p>

                    Young women who followed the band during their touring days also became popular due to Guns ‘N Roses popularity. These young women were known as roadies, and were the subject of many sexual assault scandals by band members during the 80’s. One of these women was reportedly sound recorded during the act and the sounds were used in the song ‘Rocket Queen’ without her knowledge. These roadies were also sent to do some of frontman Axl Rose’s dirty work, including travelling overseas to fetch a jacket, taking over vocals during a concert, and many other ridiculous favors too explicit to mention. It will be interesting to see how the band, and Rose, treats their female keyboardist, Melissa Reese, given their history with young women in the past. </p>

                   Kurt Cobain was the frontman for the band Nirvana, who were popular in the early nineties. The band which consisted of Cobain on guitar and vocals, Dave Grohl on drums, and Krist Novoselic on Bass. Nirvana is most known for their hit songs, “Smells like teen spirit” (1991) and “All apologies” (1993). However, the most notable thing about the band centers around the band’s lead singer, Kurt Cobain. Cobain suffered from depression and struggled with drug addiction. As a result from these illnesses and the pressures of fame, Cobain committed suicide via a gunshot to the head in April 1994.</p>

                    Nirvana made an impact on the music industry by redefining rock music  in the early 1990’s. However, not all of Nirvana’s impact on society was beneficial. Kurt Cobain became someone that teens looked up to in the mid nineties. Because of Cobain’s struggle with drugs, teens that looked up to him were trying illegal drugs and becoming addicted. One of the most troublesome, but also beneficial impacts that Cobain had on society was on the issue of suicide. Cobain’s suicide was glamourized, causing more and more teens to want to commit suicide to either be like Cobain or with Cobain in the afterlife. Because of this, parents became more aware of the signs of suicidal ideation, and mental illnesses such as depression became less stigmatized than what they previously were. </p>

They are most known for their hit song “creep” (1993). Their sound changed in the early 2000s causing precious fans to either love their music or to hate it. Despite this split, their 2000 album “Kid A” was named best album of the decade by multiple music publications. Being one of the most highest grossing bands of the 21st  century, Radiohead was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019, just two years after they became eligible.</p>

                    Radiohead has had the most influence on society through how they have shaped rock music. They are perhaps the band who has made pop rock a common genre in pop music today. Unlike many other bands and musicians on this list, they have had very few controversies dealing with sex, drugs, and alcohol. Instead, their most known controversy happened recently in 2017 on a date during their 20th anniversary tour for the album “OK Computer”. The band made headlines by performing their longest set to date on their Tel Aviv, Israel tour date. This performance came after many other musicians called for them to call off the concert because of an international cultural boycott of Israel at the time. Lead Singer Thom Yorke responded to the comments on their performance, stating the reason he went against the request to boycott Israel was "Playing in a country isn't the same as endorsing the government. Music, art and academia is about crossing borders not building them, about open minds not closed ones, about shared humanity, dialogue and freedom of expression."</p>

                   Fall Out Boy is a rock band that was formed in Chicago Illinois in 2001. They first broke into the US with a revived punk rock sound, now called pop punk. Their 2003 album “Take This to Your Grave” is said to be one of the most influential blueprint albums for the pop punk movement. Consisting of lead singer Patrick Stump, bassist and lyricist Pete Wents, and guitarist Joe Trohman, the band struggled to find a drummer until they came across Andy Hurley in late 2003. The band became popular with their 2005 album, “From Under The Cork Tree”, with hits including “Sugar, We’re Going Down” and “Dance, Dance”. However his album was just a starting point for the band. They are still widely known today, and have paired up with multiple famous musicians including Elton John. Fall Out Boy is currently planning the release of their eighth album sometime in the near future. </p>

                    Apart from their sound, Fall Out Boy is most noted for their lyrics written by Pete Wentz. While the band’s first popular tracks followed the stereotypical rock lyrics of love, breakups, and alcohol, their tone changed with their 2008 album “Folie à deux”. With this album, Wentz included lyrics dealing with depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses such as those in the song “What a Catch, Donnie”. These lyrics inspired and still inspire those who were suffering with a mental illness to keep pushing through, unlike what Cobain inspired with his suicide. Fall Out Boy is said to be one of the first bands to break the stigma of mental illnesses through the lyrics of their songs.</p>
